# My Stats
These days every company that provides you a service tracks information about you. Google for instance tracks your location every few minutes and stores it. This can be neat for viewing your location history over time and reminiscing about trips and events. However, it can be quite unsettling to realize that Google knows where you've been nearly every minute since you've gotten your phone. 

Thanks to the GDPR users can now download all the information that companies have about the user, and delete it from the servers. The goal of this project is to let you explore the data you've downloaded in an easy-to-use interface.
